Setup Wi-Fi for RMTT and RMEP
-----------------------------

All the drones and robots are tested with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. 
It is advisible to assign static IPs to the RMTT drones and RMEP robots using the router settings and label the robots and drones with their IPs for ease of use. 
If dynamic IP are used, enable `random_assign` option in the `robomaster_server.yaml` file.

Use the `setup_wifi.yaml` file to setup the configuration required.

Drones:

Connect the external module to the RMTT drones, switch the connection mode to **direct** (AP mode) connection and power on all the drones.

Robots:

Turn on the robots and switch the connection mode to **router** connection.

Once all the drones and robots are powered on, run the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    source install/setup.bash
    ros2 launch robomaster_ros2 setup_wifi.launch.py

This will connect your PC to the RMTT drones one by one and excecute the necessary commands to set up the Wi-Fi connection. 

The QR code will be displayed on seperate window. press the red/white small button on the side of the robot's connection switch and scan it using the robot's camera to connect the robot to the Wi-Fi network.


Once the setup is done, drones need turn off and switch to the **router** (STA mode) connection mode.
Now when the drones are powered on, they will connect to the Wi-Fi network and propeller will start spinning at low speed. This indicates the connection is successful. (It can take couple of minutes)

.. tip:: 
    You can flip the drone >90Â° to stop the propellers.

.. note::
    This setup procedure is generally only required once. If a drone or robot is unable to connect to the network, repeat the setup process for the specific robot/drone.

Start the robomaster server
---------------------------

Once all the drones, robots and PC are connected to the Wi-Fi network, robomaster server can be started.

Check the `rmtt_param.yaml` and `rmep_param.yaml` files to ensure the parameters are set correctly for the drones and robots.

Check the `robomaster_server.yaml` file to ensure the local IP, number of drones and robots are set correctly.

.. code-block:: bash

    source install/setup.bash
    ros2 launch robomaster_ros2 robomaster_server.launch.py

Launch arguments for `robomaster_server.launch.py`:

.. note:: 
    This values will override the parameters indicated in the `robomaster_server.yaml` file if num_of_drones or num_of_eps1 are non zero.

- `num_of_drones`: Number of drones to be added in the server
- `num_of_eps1`: Number of eps1 to be added in the server
- `local_ip`: Local IP address of the computer running the server
- `random_assign`: Random assignment for drone/robot allocation
- `keyboard_cmd`: Enable keyboard command control for drones
